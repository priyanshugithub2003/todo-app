- Adding Tasks: When a user types in a task and clicks the "Add Task" button, it creates a new task object, displays it in the task list, and stores it in the browser’s local storage.
- Mark as Completed: Clicking the checkmark (✔) toggles the task between completed and incomplete states by adding/removing the completed class.
- Delete Task: Clicking the delete button (✖) removes the task both from the list and from local storage.
- Search and Filter: You can filter tasks by "All", "Completed", and "Incomplete" using the filter buttons. The JavaScript code uses the data-filter attribute to display only the relevant tasks.
- Persistent Data: The tasks persist even after refreshing the page
